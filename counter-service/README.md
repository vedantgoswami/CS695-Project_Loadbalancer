1. **Counter-Service Program (`counter-service.c`)**:
   - This file defines the main server program (`counter-service`) using Civetweb.
   - It includes `"civetweb.h"` for Civetweb functionalities and `"functions_map.h"` for managing function mappings.
   - The `main` function initializes the server using Civetweb, sets up request handling using the `handle_request` function, and starts the server to listen for incoming HTTP requests.
   - The `handle_request` function is responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests by looking up the appropriate handler function based on the request URI and invoking it to generate a response.

2. **Function Mappings (`functions.c` and `functions_map.c`)**:
   - These files define handler functions for specific HTTP requests and manage function mappings between request paths and handler functions.
   - `functions.c` contains the implementations of the handler functions (`get_and_increment_counter`, `get_counter`, `reset_counter`).
   - `functions_map.c` contains the logic for managing a hash table that maps request paths to handler functions.
   - The hash table is initialized, and functions are registered with specific request paths using the `FUNCTION_MAPS` macro in `functions.c`.

3. **Function Mapping Header (`functions_map.h`)**:
   - This header file provides declarations, macros, and function prototypes related to managing function mappings.
   - It defines the `api_function` type for function pointers used in the handler functions.
   - It declares functions for initializing, freeing, and managing the function mappings hash table (`init_hash_table`, `insert_item`, `get_method_function`, etc.).
   - It defines macros (`INIT_FUNC_MAP`, `DEFINE_FUNC_MAP`, `FUNCTION_MAPS`) to simplify the process of defining and initializing function mappings.

4. **Makefile**:
   - The Makefile automates the build process for the `counter-service` program and its dependencies.
   - It specifies rules for compiling the source files (`counter-service.c`, `functions.c`, `functions_map.c`) and linking them with the Civetweb library (`libcivetweb.a`).
   - It includes a platform-specific Makefile from the Civetweb library directory to ensure compatibility with the target operating system.
   - It defines targets for building (`all`) and cleaning (`clean`) the project files.

In summary, these files work together to create a simple HTTP server (`counter-service`) using the Civetweb library. The server handles specific HTTP requests by routing them to appropriate handler functions defined in `functions.c`. The function mappings are managed using a hash table implemented in `functions_map.c`, and the Makefile automates the build process for the server and its dependencies.
