## Deployment Instructions
1. To deploy the application, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    docker compose up
    ```
    This command will read the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the directory and start the services defined within.

2. Profiles of the containers will be stored in the `profiling_engine.log` file.
